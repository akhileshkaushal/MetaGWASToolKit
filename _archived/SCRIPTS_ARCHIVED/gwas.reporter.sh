# You can use the variables below (indicated by "#$") to set some things for the 
# submission system.
#$ -S /bin/bash # the type of BASH you'd like to use
#$ -N QCMEGAPLOT # the name of this script
# -hold_jid some_other_basic_bash_script # the current script (basic_bash_script) will hold until some_other_basic_bash_script has finished
#$ -o /hpc/dhl_ec/svanderlaan/projects/megastroke/plotter_qc_v1_20160713.log # the log file of this job
#$ -e /hpc/dhl_ec/svanderlaan/projects/megastroke/plotter_qc_v1_20160713.errors # the error file of this job
#$ -l h_rt=00:30:00 # h_rt=[max time, e.g. 02:02:01] - this is the time you think the script will take
#$ -l h_vmem=4G #  h_vmem=[max. mem, e.g. 45G] - this is the amount of memory you think your script will use
# -l tmpspace=64G # this is the amount of temporary space you think your script will use
# -pe threaded=3 # this is to indicate the number of "threads", i.e. cores you'd want to use to parameterize your job
#$ -M s.w.vanderlaan-2@umcutrecht.nl # you can send yourself emails when the job is done; "-M" and "-m" go hand in hand
#$ -m ea # you can choose: b=begin of job; e=end of job; a=abort of job; s=
#$ -cwd # set the job start to the current directory - so all the things in this script are relative to the current directory!!!
#
# Another useful tip: you can set a job to run after another has finished. Name the job 
# with "-N SOMENAME" and hold the other job with -hold_jid SOMENAME". 
# Further instructions: https://wiki.bioinformatics.umcutrecht.nl/bin/view/HPC/HowToS#Run_a_job_after_your_other_jobs
#
# It is good practice to properly name and annotate your script for future reference for
# yourself and others. Trust me, you'll forget why and how you made this!!!
