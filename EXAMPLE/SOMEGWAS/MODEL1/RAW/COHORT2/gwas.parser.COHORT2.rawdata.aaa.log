    * Description:  Results parsing of GWAS summary statistics files used for a downstream meta-analysis of GWAS. 
    The script should be usuable on both any Linux distribution with R 3+ installed, Mac OS X and Windows.

* Clearing the environment...


* Loading function to install packages...


* Checking availability of required packages and installing if needed...


Done! Required packages installed and loaded.

* Checking the settings as given through the flags.
 - The project directory....................: /hpc/local/CentOS7/dhl_ec/software/MetaGWASToolKit/EXAMPLE
 - The GWAS data ...........................: /hpc/local/CentOS7/dhl_ec/software/MetaGWASToolKit/EXAMPLE/SOMEGWAS/MODEL1/RAW/COHORT2/COHORT2.rawdata.aaa
 - The output directory.....................: SOMEGWAS/MODEL1/RAW/COHORT2

Starting "GWAS Parser".

We are going to parse the GWAS data, by parsing and doing some initial quality control of the data.
            
Analysing these results...............: 'COHORT2.rawdata.aaa'
            Parsed results will be saved here.....: 'SOMEGWAS/MODEL1/RAW/COHORT2'.

Today's date is: 20180809.

Checking existence of output directory and creating it if necessary.
* 'SOMEGWAS/MODEL1/RAW/COHORT2' exists in '/hpc/local/CentOS7/dhl_ec/software/MetaGWASToolKit/EXAMPLE' and is a directory...
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Loading GWAS data.

* The file appears not to be gzipped, checking delimiter now...
* Data header looks like this:
[1] "Marker Chr Position Effect_allele Other_allele Strand Beta SE Pval EAF Hwe N Imputed Info"


* Data is space-seperated, loading...

* Selecting required columns, and creating them if not present...
* Renaming columns where necessary...
* Removing leading 'zeros' from chromosome number...
* Changing 23 to X, 24 to Y, 25 to XY, and 26 to MT...
* Calculating 'allele frequencies'...
* Other alleles are present, calculating minor allele frequency...
- calculating 'MAF' using 'effect allele frequency'...
* Calculating 'minor allele count' (MAC)...
* Creating the final parsed dataset.
- making empty dataframe...
- adding data to dataframe...
  > adding the new markers; these will have the form [ chr<#>:<#>:MinorAllele_MajorAllele] ...

  > adding the original markers...
  > changing NA to '0' for Chr...
  > changing NA to '0' for BP...
  > adding strand information...
  > adding alleles...
  > adding allele statistics...
  > adding test statistics...
  > adding sample information statistics...
* All done creating the final parsed dataset.

Saving parsed data...

All done parsing [ COHORT2.rawdata ].
